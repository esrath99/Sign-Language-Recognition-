# Sign-Language-Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 

# Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing and classifying hand gestures from image datasets. The model is designed to accurately classify 29 different hand gestures, including alphabetic characters (A-Z) and specific gestures such as 'delete,' 'nothing,' and 'space.'
